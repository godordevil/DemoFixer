DemoFixer v1.4 - README


What is it:
===============
DemoFixer is a utility that "attempts" to correct playback issues for demos recorded in the game Soldier Of Fortune 2: Double Helix v1.00.
Unplayable demos have plagued SOF2 v1.00 since its release, due to inconsistencies in the games engine code. 
It was created by Sweating Bullets a.k.a. GodOrDevil for the SOF2 community in hopes that it will be useful to players involved in clan wars, server administration, movie making, and more.  


Website:
===============
The DemoFixer can be found at http://www.github.com/godordevil


How to Install:
===============
Installation is not necessary.  Simply run the 'DemoFixer.exe' file.  It does not have to be in the same folder as your demo files.


How to use it:
===============
1.) Run DemoFixer.exe
2.) Drag the demo file into the command window and press ENTER
3.) Check that there are no errors.  If there is a program error or errors related to the demo parsing, report it to the website listed above.
4.) Test the demo that was created by using the "/demo <demoname>" command in the game.


How to record demos:
===============
1.) While in a game, open the console and type "/g_synchronousclients 1; record; g_synchronousclients 0;"
2.) When you want to stop recording open the console and type "/stoprecord"

*note: you can also bind this to keys. (eg.  /bind p "g_synchronousclients 1; record; g_synchronousclients 0;"


How to view demos:
===============
1.) Locate your demos folder either in the base directory or if you recorded while playing a modded server check the mods directory (ie.  <sof2>/RPM/demos ).
2.) Use the DemoFixer on the demo you recorded (see: 'How to use it' in the above section).
3.) Go back in the game, open the console and type "/demo" followed the name of the demo (eg. "/demo demo0000" ).
